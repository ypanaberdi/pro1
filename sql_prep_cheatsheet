#NORMALIZATION
1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
Each table cell should contain a single value.
Each record needs to be unique.

The data depends on the key [1NF],
the whole key [2NF] + [1NF]
and nothing but the key [3NF] + [2NF].
BCNF - Boyce-Codd, When Primary key = All other columns 

#KEYS
super keys: all kind of keys including redundant columns.
candidate keys: unique keys that doesn't need to include redundant keys, subset of super keys.
primary keys: one unique key that are taken from candidate keys.
alternate keys: all other candidate keys that are not chosen as a primary one.
Compound(can have foreigh keys)
Composite(may or may not have foreighn keys)
Surrogate key -an artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record
Foreighn key can be null

#INDEXES
B-TREE (Always balanced, depth is equal at every leaf)
Tree + Double LinkedList
O(log(n)) - for B-tree,

why index might be slow?
An index lookup requires three steps: (1) the tree traversal; (2) following the leaf node chain; (3) fetching the table data.
