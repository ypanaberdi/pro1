#NORMALIZATION
1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
Each table cell should contain a single value.
Each record needs to be unique.

The data depends on the key [1NF],
the whole key [2NF] + [1NF]
and nothing but the key [3NF] + [2NF].
BCNF - Boyce-Codd, When Primary key = All other columns 

#KEYS
super keys: all kind of keys including redundant columns.
candidate keys: unique keys that doesn't need to include redundant keys, subset of super keys.
primary keys: one unique key that are taken from candidate keys.
alternate keys: all other candidate keys that are not chosen as a primary one.
Compound(can have foreigh keys)
Composite(may or may not have foreighn keys)
Surrogate key -an artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record
Foreighn key can be null

#INDEXES
B-TREE (Always balanced, depth is equal at every leaf)
Tree + Double LinkedList
O(log(n)) - for B-tree,

why index might be slow?
An index lookup requires three steps: (1) the tree traversal; (2) following the leaf node chain; (3) fetching the table data.

Even though the two-index solution delivers very good select performance as well, the single-index solution is preferable.
It not only saves storage space, but also the maintenance overhead for the second index.
The fewer indexes a table has, the better the insert, delete and update performance.

The query optimizer, or query planner, is the database component that transforms an SQL statement into an execution plan. This process is also called compiling or parsing. There are two distinct optimizer types.

Cost-based optimizers (CBO) generate many execution plan variations and calculate a cost value for each plan. The cost calculation is based on the operations in use and the estimated row numbers. In the end the cost value serves as the benchmark for picking the “best” execution plan.

Rule-based optimizers (RBO) generate the execution plan using a hard-coded rule set. Rule based optimizers are less flexible and are seldom used today.

#STATISTICS
VACUUM -- garbage-collect and optionally analyze a database
VACUUM ANALYZE performs a VACUUM and then an ANALYZE for each selected table.
