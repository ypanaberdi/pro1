#Normalization
1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
Each table cell should contain a single value.
Each record needs to be unique.

The data depends on the key [1NF],
the whole key [2NF]
and nothing but the key [3NF].

#keys
super keys: all kind of keys including redundant columns.
candidate keys: unique keys that doesn't need to include redundant keys, subset of super keys.
primary keys: one unique key that are taken from candidate keys.
